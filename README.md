# Visual Intersection Observer

## Problem

There is a great [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) that allows (among others) to observe if website elements are present in the viewport or not. The missing part in that API is that one can never use [Visual Viewport](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/VisualViewport) as the root for the `IntersectionObserver`. At the time of writing, there is an open discussion regarding this issue [here](https://github.com/w3c/IntersectionObserver/issues/95).

So, in other words, `IntersectionObserver` works great as long as the user does not zoom the website in or out. As soon as this happens, the intersections reported by the `IntersectionObserver` are invalid.

## Solution

A `Visual Intersection Observer` that acts as a wrapping utility for the `Intersection Observer`, which modifies the `rootMargin` appropriately to the `Visual Viewport`.

Here's the [demo](https://juo.github.io/visual-intersection-observer/) to see it in action.


| Layout Viewport | Visual Viewport | Both |
| - | - | - |
| ![Layout Viewport](resources/layout.png) | ![Visual Viewport](resources/visual.png) | ![Both](resources/both.png) |

## Known issues

- When the document width is larger than the viewport, the intersection is not computed properly on mobile devices.
- Chrome and Firefox on mobile sometimes report an incorrect width/height of the Visual Viewport
